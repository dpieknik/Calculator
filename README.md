<h1>Calculator</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a rudimentary calculator where I chose to play with the switch case decision tree. I was happy to learn this logic exists in both JavaScript and Python 
and has become my preferred method in handling similar decision trees.This project was before I started editing the DOM directly.
